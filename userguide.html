               <ul class="checkmark-list">
        <li>First, you will need to download the LCW app on the app store for iOS or GooglePlay store for Android.</li>
        <li>Select “Quick Setup” and enter in a password. You will need to store this password somewhere safe as the LCW does not store personal information, collect data or track usage. Please see the Privacy Policy for more information.</li>
        <li>Select “Take Me To My Wallet.” During this setup process, the wallet will create a default profile with a digital identity called a decentralized identifier, or DID. A DID is a permanent, unique ID number stored in your wallet that proves who you are to web entities.</li>
        <li>Your wallet is now set up and ready to store credentials</li>           
    </ul>
            <h2 class="pb-2 text-center">How to claim a credential</h2>
            <p class="pt-4">There are several ways you may receive a credential. Your institution may send you an email containing a link or a QR code or there may be instructions for claiming your credential on a course platform or website. Here are the ways you can claim and add your credential to the LCW. </p>
            <h2 class="pb-2"> From a QR code:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Scan the QR code using the camera on your mobile device. If you have downloaded the LCW, this should open the application on your phone. </li>
                <li>Select your profile.</li>
                <li>Select "Accept."</li>
                <li>You will be navigated to the “credential preview” which shows you the rendered credential.</li>
                <li>When you return “home” you will see the credential listed. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="pb-2"> Paste JSON or URL (a web link)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigate to the “Add Credential” page on the LCW. This is indicated by the plus sign icon on the bottom navigation.</li> 
                <li>Locate the box “Paste JSON or URL.” If you have a URL or a link you can paste that link into the box. Additionally, if you have JSON — which is a block of code — you can paste that code into the box. Select Add.</li> 
                <li>Select your profile.</li>
                <li>Select “Accept.”</li>
                <li>You will be navigated to the “credential preview” which shows you the rendered credential.</li>
                <li>When you return “home” you will see the credential listed.</li> 
            </ul>
            <h2 class="pb-2"> From file </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You may have received a file containing the credential code, or JSON. Save this file so that you can access it from your mobile device.</li> 
                <li>Navigate to the “Add Credential” page on the LCW. This is indicated by the plus sign icon on the bottom navigation. </li>
                <li>Select “Add from file” and select the file in your phone. Select your profile.</li>
                <li>Select “Accept.”</li>
                <li>You will be navigated to the “credential preview” which shows you the rendered credential.</li>
                <li> When you return “home” you will see the credential listed. </li>
              </ul>
            <h2 class="pb-2"> From a badge image </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Some credential issuers may be issuing OBv3 but using an approach called “badge images.” In this case, the process is similar to uploading your credential “from file” as described above. However, the file must be a .png image. For more information on this please visit the DCC blog. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="pb-2"> How to share a credential</h2>
            <p class="p-small"> There are a number of ways to share your credential. Most of them require you to “create a public link.” This means that the LCW will create a link that is hosted on a server currently maintained by the DCC. This is a public URL, meaning that anyone with the link can view your verified credential in the DCC verification app called VerifierPlus. For more information on what a public link means with regards to data privacy, please see the LCW Privacy Policy. <br>
                To share a credential from the LCW:
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigate to your home page. From here you can either
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select the share icon on the bottom navigation. Select “Create Public Link.” This will ask you to select the credential you want to share. Then select “Create Link.</li>
                            <li>OR select the credential you want to share then select the three dots in the top right corner and select “share.” Then select “Create a public link.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Once you have created a public link, you will be able to share your credential as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A deeplink or URL: Select “Copy” and send the URL via email, text message or other channels.</li>
                            <li>A text file: Select “Send Credential” and choose from your device where you would like to send the file. Note that this file will not be a rendered image of the credential but the JSON code. More information on how to use this code is explained below in the section on VerifierPlus. </li>
                            <li>A QR code: A person seeking to verify your credential can scan the QR code on your LCW using their mobile device. </li>
                            <li>Share to Linkedin: Select “Add to Linkedin Profile” and then “Add to Linkedin.” This will prompt your mobile device to open the Linkedin app if you have it downloaded and log into your Linkedin account. From here you can add your credential to your Linkedin profile.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
