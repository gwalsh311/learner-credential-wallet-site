How it works
The way we learn has been transformed by technology. Whether in traditional classrooms, online programs, or workplace and life experiences, we are acquiring knowledge and skills and increasingly sharing them across the web in pursuit of opportunities. To protect our personal information while showcasing the skills and achievements we value, we need a credentialing system that matches innovation in education and learning.
A digital credential is a digital version of an achievement. You may have already received one if you have taken an online course or attended an institution that grants e-diplomas. However, not all digital credentials follow the same technical standards. This means that not all digital credentials can be stored in every wallet.
